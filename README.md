Prepinsta Data Analysis Week 3

Description:

This project involves data analysis of a dataset using the Pandas and Numpy libraries for manipulation and analysis, and Seaborn for visualization to clearly understand the data. This analysis helps in extracting meaningful insights and patterns from the data. We are dealing with conversion of 'tsv' to 'csv' of the 'chipotle' dataset.

Installation Instructions:

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries. Follow the instructions below:
1.Install Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the required libraries:
  pip install numpy pandas seaborn

Dependencies and Libraries:
This project requires the following libraries:
Numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Data Analysis Using Python
Data analysis using Python involves various steps:

Data Collection: Gathering data from different sources.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
Data Manipulation: Using Pandas for transforming and analyzing the data.
Data Visualization: Using Seaborn to create visualizations that help in understanding trends, patterns, and insights.
Drawing Conclusions: Based on the analysis and visualizations, making informed decisions or predictions.
Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, provides powerful tools for data analysis and visualization, making it easier to understand complex datasets and derive actionable insights.
